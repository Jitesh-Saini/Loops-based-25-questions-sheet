 Basic Loop-Based Mathematical Questions
 (Notepad + Copy)
1. Print numbers from 1 to N (using for loop, while loop and do-while loop)
Input: N
 Output: 1 2 3 ... N

2. Print sum of first N natural numbers(for loop, while loop and do-while loop)
1+2+3+4+5+6
Example: N=5 → Output: 15

3. Print sum of even numbers from 1 to N (for loop while loop and do-while loop)
Example: N=10 → 2+4+6+8+10 = 30

4. Print sum of odd numbers from 1 to N( for loop while loop and do-while loop)
Start value user input and End value hai wo bhi user input hoga
Example: N=7 → 1+3+5+7 = 16

5. Count digits in a number (while and do-while)
Example: 4582 → 4 digits
Best case : 1 
Worst case:10^9 -1 
Algorithmic time complexity derive  

6. Reverse a number(check all the cases like succeeding zeros)
(While loop and do-while loop) ⇒ (don’t change the data-type keep it integer)
Example: 1234 → 4321
1000 = = 0001 
120500 = 005021 

7. Check if a number is a palindrome ( using while and do-while loop )
Example: 121 → palindrome

8. Find factorial of a number (for loop while loop and do-while loop)
Example: 5 → 120

9. Print multiplication table of a number.(only with for loop )
Example: N=7 → 7 14 21 … 70
I = 1-15 and J = 1-10 
1 * 1 = 1 
1 * 2 = 2
 
10. Print all divisors of a number (for while and do-while)
Example: 12 → 1,2,3,4,6,12
 15 : 1, 3 ,5 , 15
O(n)
0(n/2) two pointer approach

11. Check if the number is prime
0(n)
0(n/2)
Sqrt of n
Use loop to check divisibility.

12. Print Fibonacci series up to N terms(for loop)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8…

13. Find power of a number using loop(for while and do-while)
Example: 2^5 = 32 (no pow() allowed)

14. Sum of digits of a number(do-while for while)
Example: 789 → 7+8+9 = 24
12345=1+2+3+45

15. Product of digits of a number (for while do-while loop)
Example: 345 → 3×4×5 = 60

16. Find the largest digit of a number(while loop)
Example: 6395 → largest = 9

17. Find the smallest digit of a number(do-while loop)
Example: 6395 → smallest = 3

18. Check Armstrong number using loop
Example: 153 → 1³+5³+3³ = 153

19. Print numbers divisible by A and B between 1 to N
Example: divisible by 3 & 5 → 15, 30, 45…
Divisible by 4 and 16 

20. Find GCD (HCF) of two numbers using loop


21. Find the total count of 8 in a digit.

22. Check if the number N is a power of 7 if it is then find which power? 

23. Using ( for loop and while loop) iterate and start with 1 to nth number jump by 
2
4
5
6 
8
10





24. Take a number from user add the first digit and last digit.
153 =1 + 3 =4
15935=1+5=6


25. Take a number from user get the first digit and last digit 
9533 = first number = 9
          = last digit = 3
For loop >> 1-9 
     Run a for loop from 1 till first digit 
Do-while 3-0
     Run a do-while loop from last digit to 0.
